"""ADR-117 §7.2 — Unit test for the v1.99.0 tombstone wheel.

Verifies the *file content* of the tombstone module without actually
importing it (importing it would raise ImportError, which is the
behaviour under test). The CI workflow `pip-release.yml` runs the
real end-to-end install + import test inside an ephemeral venv.
